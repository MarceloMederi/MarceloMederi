My name is Marcelo Medeiros I'm 31 years old and in the last year of S.I

I'm interested in learning programming languages ​​and I'm currently writing some simple python code.

I always try to add knowledge to my portfolio. I like to practice what I've learned and programming is no different.

I don't know much, but I'm willing to talk and learn with my colleagues.
